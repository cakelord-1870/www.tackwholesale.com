<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Derby Originals Superior Slow Feed Soft Mesh Hanging Hay Nets for Horses offer a superior slow feeding option to traditional hay nets. Unlike standard hay nets, which are made of brittle and easily fraying and breaking poly rope, our hay nets are made from soft mesh rope that has an incredibly high breaking strength, is long-lasting, and is UV, mold, and mildew resistant. Our slow feed hay nets have been carefully designed to be comfortable for your horse to use and eat from and are more gentle on their teeth and gums than traditional hay nets or other feeders. Our hay nets are available in a wide array of sizes and colors so that you can find the perfect net for you and your horse!</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Please be aware that all Derby Originals soft mesh hay nets are made by hand, and may have slight variation in overall size and the size of the openings. All measurements and capacities listed are approximate. The amount of hay that our hay nets can hold varies greatly due to the type of hay being fed, the dimensions of the hay bale, and the size of the hay flake.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">PREVENTS EXCESS HAY WASTAGE - our slow feed hay nets are designed to help you save money and reduce waste by over 50%. These hay nets prevent hay from being scattered or soiled which is beneficial to your horse's health as well as your wallet.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">IMPROVES YOUR HORSE'S DIGESTION - hay nets allow you to slow feed your horse, which mimics natural grazing patterns and is proven to aid the digestive process. Slow feeding is recommended by veterinarians to prevent gastric ulcers and colic.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">REDUCES BOREDOM - horses are designed to spend up to 16 hours a day grazing. Slow feeding replicates this natural behavior and keeps your horse occupied longer, which helps to prevent boredom-based bad behaviors such as chewing, cribbing, and pacing.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">EXCLUSIVE SOFT MESH DESIGN - our slow feed hay nets are made from a soft but durable poly rope that is better for your horse's teeth and gum health and more comfortable to eat from than hard metal feeders and traditional hay nets.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">HOLDS APPROX. 5-7 FLAKES - this slow feed hay net can hold about 5-7 flakes or up to a half of a 2-string or square bale of hay. These hay nets are great for everyday feeding and can be used in stalls, trailers, and pastures.</span></li>

<p>Derby Originals Superior Slow Feed Soft Mesh Hanging Hay Nets for Horses offer a superior slow feeding option to traditional hay nets. Unlike standard hay nets, which are made of brittle and easily fraying and breaking poly rope, our hay nets are made from soft mesh rope that has an incredibly high breaking strength, is long-lasting, and is UV, mold, and mildew resistant. Our slow feed hay nets have been carefully designed to be comfortable for your horse to use and eat from and are more gentle on their teeth and gums than traditional hay nets or other feeders. Our hay nets are available in a wide array of sizes and colors so that you can find the perfect net for you and your horse!<br><br data-mce-fragment="1"></p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1"><span data-mce-fragment="1" style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">Please be aware that all Derby Originals soft mesh hay nets are made by hand, and may have slight variation in overall size and the size of the openings. All measurements and capacities listed are approximate. The amount of hay that our hay nets can hold varies greatly due to the type of hay being fed, the dimensions of the hay bale, and the size of the hay flake.</span></p>
