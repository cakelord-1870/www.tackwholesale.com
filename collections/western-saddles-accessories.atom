<p><b>Care Instructions</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This Western saddle blanket should be regularly cleaned and maintained in order to ensure your horse's comfort and prolong the lifespan of the blanket. Never machine wash or dry your blanket. Instead, you should regularly clean it of dirt and fur by gently brushing it with a soft brush. Next, use a vacuum hose to remove any remaining debris from your blanket. Once your blanket is mostly clean, you can wash it with lukewarm to cold water and Woolite™ or specialty saddle pad cleaner to remove any further dirt and sweat. It's important that, after washing, you store your blanket properly on a rack without any tack on top of it to allow it to maintain its shape and thoroughly dry out.</span></p></td>

<p><b>Care Instructions</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This Western saddle blanket should be regularly cleaned and maintained in order to ensure your horse's comfort and prolong the lifespan of the blanket. Never machine wash or dry your blanket. Instead, you should regularly clean it of dirt and fur by gently brushing it with a soft brush. Next, use a vacuum hose to remove any remaining debris from your blanket. Once your blanket is mostly clean, you can wash it with lukewarm to cold water and Woolite™ or specialty saddle pad cleaner to remove any further dirt and sweat. It's important that, after washing, you store your blanket properly on a rack without any tack on top of it to allow it to maintain its shape and thoroughly dry out.</span></p></td>

<p><b>Care Instructions</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This Western saddle blanket should be regularly cleaned and maintained in order to ensure your horse's comfort and prolong the lifespan of the blanket. Never machine wash or dry your blanket. Instead, you should regularly clean it of dirt and fur by gently brushing it with a soft brush. Next, use a vacuum hose to remove any remaining debris from your blanket. Once your blanket is mostly clean, you can wash it with lukewarm to cold water and Woolite™ or specialty saddle pad cleaner to remove any further dirt and sweat. It's important that, after washing, you store your blanket properly on a rack without any tack on top of it to allow it to maintain its shape and thoroughly dry out.</span></p></td>

Although these stirrups are beautifully hand engraved, they are not bulky or overly flashy in a way that will distract from the riders performance. These stirrups are versatile and can be used in a variety of western events including western pleasure, horsemanship, trail, gymkhana barrel racing, and everyday riding on the trails. They simply add the right amount of elegance and comfort to your existing tack set. These stirrups only feature the engraved design on one side of each stirrup and are sold in pairs. The color/shade of the leather pieces on these stirrups may very slightly from lot to lot.  </span></p>
