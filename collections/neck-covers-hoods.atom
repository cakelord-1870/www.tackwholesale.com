<p><span>THE PERFECT BLANKET HOOD - this blanket is the perfect winter blanket hood for almost any horse and climate, due to its highly adjustable design, hefty 150g of Polyfil, and sturdy ripstop nylon shell.</span></p>

<p><span>Dried mud, hair, hay, and other debris should be regularly brushed off your blanket. A stiff dandy brush often works best for this. Keeping your blanket clean helps extend its lifespan, as well as help to keep your horse clean and happy. You can also use a damp, soapy rag to remove mud/debris and then wipe your blanket dry. Fleece blankets should only be hand washed and never machine washed. All removable parts should be removed before washing, all velcro straps velcroed together, and your blanket should only be washed in a detergent made for use with horse blankets, or gentle animal-safe cleaners. When washing, use cool water and hand wash gently. Do not use fabric softener with any of our blankets as it will damage their waterproofing and breathing abilities and prevent the blanket from wicking water and sweat off your horse. All of our blankets should be air-dried or line-dried, never put in a dryer. If your blanket becomes nicked or torn, the blanket should immediately be sewn or patched to prevent further damage from occurring.</span></p></td>

    <td colspan="2"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our 600D Ripstop Nylon Waterproof Heavyweight Winter Horse Blanket Hood was designed to provide an extra layer of protection against the elements, even in the most severe weather, for your horse’s sensitive neck. This no-rub turnout hood will not rub or damage your horse’s mane and is great for preventing snow, rain, or mud from getting on the hair. This hood has 150 grams of polyfill evenly distributed throughout it to help warm your horse and prevent chills. This hood is a great option for horses that are competing or showing during the winter season who need their manes protected, are clipped or shaved, or just need a little extra warmth.</span></p>
<br>

These blankets are guaranteed to be fully waterproof unless the blanket is ripped/torn, or the Teflon coating is damaged through improper washing or cleaning, or abuse of the blanket.</span></p>
