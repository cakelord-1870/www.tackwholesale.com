    <td colspan="2"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CuteNfuzzy's line of small pet hay feeders first premiered in 2019 and were meticulously designed and tested here in the USA. We're proud to have created a line of attractive, high-quality, innovative, long-lasting, and best-selling hay feeders designed for use with any small animal such as guinea pigs, rabbits, chinchillas, degus, and even reptiles such as tortoises! These bags are designed for easy, hassle-free, waste-free, and mess-free hay feeding. Unlike traditional wooden, plastic, or metal hay feeders that are intrusive, heavy, hard to fill, and can become dangerous for your pet, our feeders are completely safe and easy to use.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each of our small pet hay bags features a pair of high-quality stainless steel trigger snaps that make hanging this bag a breeze, as well as a d-ring on the back so you can anchor the bag to your cage wall to prevent your pet from moving or flipping it. Our bags also have a full velcro closing top to prevent hay spillage. You'll love how much less hay is wasted and how much cleaner your pet's cage stays with our hay bags! Our feeders were designed to be as hygienic as possible by keeping your hay dry and unsoiled. These bags are also easy to clean and feature a waterproof inner lining. All of the seams on these bags are sturdily reinforced for maximum longevity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Small animals have teeth that never stop growing, so they need to constantly chew in order to keep their teeth from becoming overgrown. Some pets are heavier chewers than others, and while most will not chew fabric, some pets may shred, rip, or eat fabric. For the pets who do this, we do not recommend the use of a fabric hay bag for them as they could try to ingest the fabric. Please take your pet’s individual personality, needs, and safety into consideration when choosing a hay feeder for them. We recommend keeping your hay bag full and not letting it become empty for lengths of time in order to lessen the risk of them eating the fabric. If your hay bag becomes damaged, immediately discontinue using it.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>DESIGNED WITH YOUR PETS SAFETY IN MIND - this hay bag features an all-fabric durable nylon web design with 1.25" x 2" openings for increased safety, comfort for your pet, and durability. Our hay bags were proudly designed in the USA and tested extensively.</span></li>
<li><span>PERFECT FOR GUINEA PIGS, RABBITS, CHINCHILLAS, AND MORE - these hay bags were designed for use with a wide variety of hay eating small animals. Our hay bags are sized to hold a generous amount of hay, and are safe for every day and long-term use.</span></li>
<li><span>NOT DESIGNED FOR HEAVY CHEWERS - some small pets will chew/eat fabric. For these pets, we recommend that you do not use a fabric hay feeder as they may try to ingest the fabric. Always monitor your pet and remove the hay bag if it becomes damaged.</span></li>
<li><span>EXCLUSIVE SUPER TOUGH BOTTOM DESIGN - originally designed for horses, this bottom is more durable and keeps hay fresher by providing better air flow and allowing dust to exit your pet's hay. This also makes accessing the hay easier for your pet.</span></li>
<li><span>AVAILABLE IN MULTIPLE SIZES AND COLORS - this hay pouch is available in two sizes: Small (10" long x 11" tall x 3” wide) and Large (15" long x 11" tall x 3” wide), and the colors Black, Hurricane Blue, Pink, and Dark Purple to best suit you and your pet's needs!</span></li>

    <td colspan="2"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CuteNfuzzy's line of small pet hay feeders first premiered in 2019 and were meticulously designed and tested here in the USA. We're proud to have created a line of attractive, high-quality, innovative, long-lasting, and best-selling hay feeders designed for use with any small animal such as guinea pigs, rabbits, chinchillas, degus, and even reptiles such as tortoises! These bags are designed for easy, hassle-free, waste-free, and mess-free hay feeding. Unlike traditional wooden, plastic, or metal hay feeders that are intrusive, heavy, hard to fill, and can become dangerous for your pet, our feeders are completely safe and easy to use.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each of our small pet hay bags features a pair of high-quality stainless steel trigger snaps that make hanging this bag a breeze, as well as a d-ring on the back so you can anchor the bag to your cage wall to prevent your pet from moving or flipping it. Our bags also have a full velcro closing top to prevent hay spillage. You'll love how much less hay is wasted and how much cleaner your pet's cage stays with our hay bags! Our feeders were designed to be as hygienic as possible by keeping your hay dry and unsoiled. These bags are also easy to clean and feature a waterproof inner lining. All of the seams on these bags are sturdily reinforced for maximum longevity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Small animals have teeth that never stop growing, so they need to constantly chew in order to keep their teeth from becoming overgrown. Some pets are heavier chewers than others, and while most will not chew fabric, some pets may shred, rip, or eat fabric. For the pets who do this, we do not recommend the use of a fabric hay bag for them as they could try to ingest the fabric. Please take your pet’s individual personality, needs, and safety into consideration when choosing a hay feeder for them. We recommend keeping your hay bag full and not letting it become empty for lengths of time in order to lessen the risk of them eating the fabric. If your hay bag becomes damaged, immediately discontinue using it.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">DESIGNED WITH YOUR PETS SAFETY IN MIND - this hay bag features an all-fabric durable nylon web design with  1" square openings for increased safety, comfort for your pet, and durability. Our hay bags were proudly designed in the USA and tested extensively.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">PERFECT FOR GUINEA PIGS, RABBITS, CHINCHILLAS, AND MORE - these hay bags were designed for use with a wide variety of hay eating small animals. Our hay bags are sized to hold a generous amount of hay, and are safe for every day and long-term use.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">NOT DESIGNED FOR HEAVY CHEWERS - some small pets will chew/eat fabric. For these pets, we recommend that you do not use a fabric hay feeder as they may try to ingest the fabric. Always monitor your pet and remove the hay bag if it becomes damaged.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">EXCLUSIVE SUPER TOUGH BOTTOM DESIGN - originally designed for horses, this bottom is more durable and keeps hay fresher by providing better air flow and allowing dust to exit your pet's hay. This also makes accessing the hay easier for your pet.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">MEASURES 15" LONG x 9" TALL x 5" WIDE - this hay bag is sized to perfectly fit inside most cages and comfortably accommodate 1-4 small pets. This feeder features an open nylon web front with 1" square openings to allow up to four animals to eat at once.</span></li>

This style adjusts easily on the animal and features a snap with a shorter lead that allows you to quickly secure your animal in a pen or wash rack. A great value, this halter comes in a cool selection of color combinations. Measures 52" long with the headpiece condensed.</span></p>

    <td colspan="2"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CuteNfuzzy's line of small pet hay feeders first premiered in 2019 and were meticulously designed and tested here in the USA. We're proud to have created a line of attractive, high-quality, innovative, long-lasting, and best-selling hay feeders designed for use with any small animal such as guinea pigs, rabbits, chinchillas, degus, and even reptiles such as tortoises! These bags are designed for easy, hassle-free, waste-free, and mess-free hay feeding. Unlike traditional wooden, plastic, or metal hay feeders that are intrusive, heavy, hard to fill, and can become dangerous for your pet, our feeders are completely safe and easy to use.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each of our small pet hay bags features a pair of high-quality stainless steel trigger snaps that make hanging this bag a breeze, as well as a d-ring on the back so you can anchor the bag to your cage wall to prevent your pet from moving or flipping it. Our bags also have a full velcro closing top to prevent hay spillage. You'll love how much less hay is wasted and how much cleaner your pet's cage stays with our hay bags! Our feeders were designed to be as hygienic as possible by keeping your hay dry and unsoiled. These bags are also easy to clean and feature a waterproof inner lining. All of the seams on these bags are sturdily reinforced for maximum longevity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Small animals have teeth that never stop growing, so they need to constantly chew in order to keep their teeth from becoming overgrown. Some pets are heavier chewers than others, and while most will not chew fabric, some pets may shred, rip, or eat fabric. For the pets who do this, we do not recommend the use of a fabric hay bag for them as they could try to ingest the fabric. Please take your pet’s individual personality, needs, and safety into consideration when choosing a hay feeder for them. We recommend keeping your hay bag full and not letting it become empty for lengths of time in order to lessen the risk of them eating the fabric. If your hay bag becomes damaged, immediately discontinue using it.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">DESIGNED WITH YOUR PETS SAFETY IN MIND - this hay bag features an all-fabric durable 1000D nylon design with large openings for increased safety, comfort for your pet, and durability. Our hay bags were proudly designed in the USA and tested extensively.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">PERFECT FOR GUINEA PIGS, RABBITS, CHINCHILLAS, AND MORE - these hay bags were designed for use with a wide variety of hay eating small animals. Our hay bags are sized to hold a generous amount of hay, and are safe for every day and long-term use.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">NOT DESIGNED FOR HEAVY CHEWERS - some small pets will chew/eat fabric. For these pets, we recommend that you do not use a fabric hay feeder as they may try to ingest the fabric. Always monitor your pet and remove the hay bag if it becomes damaged.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">MEASURES 15" LONG x 15" TALL x 5" WIDE - this hay bag is sized to fit inside most large cages and comfortably accommodate 1-3 small pets. This feeder features three front 2.5" diameter circular openings to allow up to three animals to eat at once.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">AVAILABLE IN MULTIPLE COLORS AND PATTERNS - our fun and colorful small pet hay feeders are available in the colors Black, Hurricane Blue, Pink, Purple, Green, and Rainbow Geometry so that you can find the perfect bag to match your pet's cage.</span></li>

A mesh butt provides added air circulation while leg gussets allow for extended leg movement. Machine wash separately in cold water, gentle cycle; line dry only; do not bleach.
