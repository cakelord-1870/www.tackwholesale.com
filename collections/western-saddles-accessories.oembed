Never machine wash or dry your blanket. Instead, you should regularly clean it of dirt and fur by gently brushing it with a soft brush. Next, use a vacuum hose to remove any remaining debris from your blanket. Once your blanket is mostly clean, you can wash it with lukewarm to cold water and Woolite™ or specialty saddle pad cleaner to remove any further dirt and sweat. It's important that, after washing, you store your blanket properly on a rack without any tack on top of it to allow it to maintain its shape and thoroughly dry out.\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e","brand":"Tahoe Tack","offers":[{"title":"Default Title","offer_id":39371626086460,"sku":"61-3003-PAT","price":119.99,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true}],"thumbnail_url":"\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/1898\/9069\/products\/Patriotic_American_Flag_Eagle_Western_Saddle_Pad_Blanket_Horse_61-3003.png?v=1625672371"},{"product_id":"tahoe-barbwire-tooled-leather-trail-saddle-set-6-items","title":"Tahoe Barbwire Tooled Leather Trail Saddle Set 6 Items","description":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan data-mce-fragment=\"1\"\u003eThis rich mahogany saddle set has everything you need to get out and ride.
