{"title":"Halter\/Bridles","description":"Our selection of halter\/bridle combos, also called field trial\/packer bridles, are an efficient piece of tack that combines both a halter and a bridle into one unique item. These bridles are perfect for trail riders because the bit can be slipped out of the horse's mouth without removing the entire ensemble, and the bit hangers can be removed to allow the combination bridle to be utilized as a halter. These efficient bridles also allow easy changing of bits, making them perfect for lesson barns or use with multiple horses.","products":[{"product_id":"90-9100","title":"Derby Padded Nylon Halter Bridle Combo with Reins Aztec Overlay","description":"Hit the trail or arena with this beautifully designed halter bridle combo.
