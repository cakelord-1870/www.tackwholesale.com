Our unique web front hay bags are designed with cross stitches at every intersection and bartack stitching at all stress points along the top, sides, and bottom of the bag. This hay bag also features our exclusive Super Tough Bottom®: a grid of reinforced nylon webbing that will never rip like solid or mesh bottoms. Our bags are built tough from premium materials and are designed to last for years to come. This hay bag is designed to be a great everyday feeder for most horses and other animals: it measures 22x10x28" and can hold about 2-3 flakes of hay. This hay bag has 3x2” rectangular front openings which will prevent hay wastage and slow down their rate of consumption, but still allow for frustration-free feeding. This premium hay bag also includes a 6-month limited manufacturer's warranty offered by Derby Originals.</span></p>

<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">SUPER TOUGH BOTTOM® DESIGN - our exclusive Super Tough Bottom® is made of reinforced overlapping nylon webbing. This design allows for superior strength and durability while keeping your hay fresh and allowing dust and debris to exit the bag.</span></li>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Derby Originals Superior Slow Feed Soft Mesh Hanging Hay Nets for Horses offer a superior slow feeding option to traditional hay nets. Unlike standard hay nets, which are made of brittle and easily fraying and breaking poly rope, our hay nets are made from soft mesh rope that has an incredibly high breaking strength, is long-lasting, and is UV, mold, and mildew resistant. Our slow feed hay nets have been carefully designed to be comfortable for your horse to use and eat from and are more gentle on their teeth and gums than traditional hay nets or other feeders. Our hay nets are available in a wide array of sizes and colors so that you can find the perfect net for you and your horse!</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Please be aware that all Derby Originals soft mesh hay nets are made by hand, and may have slight variation in overall size and the size of the openings. All measurements and capacities listed are approximate. The amount of hay that our hay nets can hold varies greatly due to the type of hay being fed, the dimensions of the hay bale, and the size of the hay flake.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">PREVENTS EXCESS HAY WASTAGE - our slow feed hay nets are designed to help you save money and reduce waste by over 50%. These hay nets prevent hay from being scattered or soiled which is beneficial to your horse's health as well as your wallet.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">IMPROVES YOUR HORSE'S DIGESTION - hay nets allow you to slow feed your horse, which mimics natural grazing patterns and is proven to aid the digestive process. Slow feeding is recommended by veterinarians to prevent gastric ulcers and colic.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">REDUCES BOREDOM - horses are designed to spend up to 16 hours a day grazing. Slow feeding replicates this natural behavior and keeps your horse occupied longer, which helps to prevent boredom-based bad behaviors such as chewing, cribbing, and pacing.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">EXCLUSIVE SOFT MESH DESIGN - our slow feed hay nets are made from a soft but durable poly rope that is better for your horse's teeth and gum health and more comfortable to eat from than hard metal feeders and traditional hay nets.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">HOLDS APPROX. 5-7 FLAKES - this slow feed hay net can hold about 5-7 flakes or up to a half of a 2-string or square bale of hay. These hay nets are great for everyday feeding and can be used in stalls, trailers, and pastures.</span></li>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Derby Originals Superior Slow Feed Soft Mesh Hanging Hay Nets for Horses offer a superior slow feeding option to traditional hay nets. Unlike standard hay nets, which are made of brittle and easily fraying and breaking poly rope, our hay nets are made from soft mesh rope that has an incredibly high breaking strength, is long-lasting, and is UV, mold, and mildew resistant. Our slow feed hay nets have been carefully designed to be comfortable for your horse to use and eat from and are more gentle on their teeth and gums than traditional hay nets or other feeders. Our hay nets are available in a wide array of sizes and colors so that you can find the perfect net for you and your horse!</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Please be aware that all Derby Originals soft mesh hay nets are made by hand, and may have slight variation in overall size and the size of the openings. All measurements and capacities listed are approximate. The amount of hay that our hay nets can hold varies greatly due to the type of hay being fed, the dimensions of the hay bale, and the size of the hay flake.</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">PREVENTS EXCESS HAY WASTAGE - our slow feed hay nets are designed to help you save money and reduce waste by over 50%. These hay nets prevent hay from being scattered or soiled which is beneficial to your horse's health as well as your wallet.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">IMPROVES YOUR HORSE'S DIGESTION - hay nets allow you to slow feed your horse, which mimics natural grazing patterns and is proven to aid the digestive process. Slow feeding is recommended by veterinarians to prevent gastric ulcers and colic.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">REDUCES BOREDOM - horses are designed to spend up to 16 hours a day grazing. Slow feeding replicates this natural behavior and keeps your horse occupied longer, which helps to prevent boredom-based bad behaviors such as chewing, cribbing, and pacing.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">EXCLUSIVE SOFT MESH DESIGN - our slow feed hay nets are made from a soft but durable poly rope that is better for your horse's teeth and gum health and more comfortable to eat from than hard metal feeders and traditional hay nets.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">HOLDS APPROX. 8-12 FLAKES - this slow feed hay net can hold about 8-12 flakes or up to a full 2-string or square bale of hay. These hay nets are great for everyday feeding and can be used in stalls, trailers, and pastures.</span></li>

    <td colspan="2"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Derby Originals 1200D Breathable Hay Bale Bags with Mesh Ventilation Flaps have revolutionized the bale bag market. Traditional bale bags are fully enclosed and can cause the hay to rot and become sour-smelling, which is potentially harmful to your animals. Our revolutionary design features 4 mesh ventilation windows around the bag to combat this problem. These vents are made of a reinforced mesh that is covered in a 1200D nylon flap. This covering still allows fresh air to enter the bag while protecting the hay inside from the rain. This exclusive design also prevents anything from entering your hay bag and spoiling your hay. This, combined with our ultra-tough 1200D nylon shell, reinforced seams, and durable zipper and carry straps results in a bale bag that is built horse tough and designed to last.</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">IMPROVED VENTILATION FOR OPTIMUM HAY FRESHNESS - our exclusive mesh ventilation window design keeps your hay cleaner, drier, and fresher than traditional bale bags. These bags have 4 total vent flaps: 2 on the front of the bag, and 1 on each side.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">ULTRA-DURABLE 1200D DESIGN - unlike other flimsy bale bags, ours is made of premium 1200D nylon fabric with reinforced seams and straps. Our bale bag is 2-3x tougher than your average bag, which is why we back them with a 1-year manufacturer's warranty.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">MAKES HAY STORAGE AND TRANSPORT EASY - our mess-free bale bags make hauling hay to events, shows, or around the farm easier than ever! Adding hay into our bags is a breeze with our wraparound zipper, and our attached carry straps make transport easy.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">GREAT FOR INDOOR OR OUTDOOR USE - indoors, our self-contained design helps minimize messes. Outdoors, our waterproof fabric keeps your hay dry while our ventilation flaps still allow fresh air to circulate inside the bale bag.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">AVAILABLE IN 2-STRING AND 3-STRING SIZES - these bale bags are available in 2 sizes: Large, measuring 44” L x 16” H x 20” W, and X-Large, measuring 52” L x 20” H x 28” W. Size Large fits 2-string square bales, and X-Large fits 3-string California bales.</span></li>

    <td colspan="2"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Paris Tack’s line of slow feed hay bags has been meticulously designed, tested, and improved over the past 15 years in order to give you a product superior to anything else available on the market. Our unique web front hay bags are designed with cross stitches at every intersection and bartack stitching at all stress points along the top, sides, and bottom of the bag. This hay bag also features our exclusive Super Tough Bottom®: a grid of reinforced nylon webbing that will never rip like solid or mesh bottoms. Our bags are built tough from premium materials and are designed to last for years to come. This hay bag is designed to be a great everyday feeder for most horses and other animals: it measures 21x7x25" and can hold about 2-3 flakes of hay. This hay bag has 1” square front openings which will prevent hay wastage and slow down their rate of consumption, but still allow for frustration-free feeding. This premium hay bag also includes a 6-month limited manufacturer's warranty offered by Derby Originals.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">HOLDS 2-3 FLAKES OF HAY - this 21x7x25" hay bag with 1" square openings holds approx. 2-3 flakes of Timothy, Orchard, Alfalfa, or any other type of hay. Our hay bags were designed to minimize frustration and can be stuffed in seconds.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">SUPER TOUGH BOTTOM® DESIGN - our exclusive Super Tough Bottom® is made of reinforced overlapping nylon webbing. This design allows for superior strength and durability while keeping your hay fresh and allowing dust and debris to exit the bag.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">DURABLE LASTING CONSTRUCTION - our heavy-duty reinforced nylon hay bag has replaceable hanging straps and snaps. This allows you to easily replace worn parts, extending the life of the bag. Many customers say their hay bag has lasted 3+ years!</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">IMPROVES DIGESTION - horses are designed to spend up to 18 hours a day grazing. Slow feeding allows you to replicate this natural behavior and is recommended by veterinarians to prevent gastric ulcers, colic, and boredom-related behavioral vices.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">SIX MONTH WARRANTY - this hay bag has a 6-month limited manufacturer's warranty offered by Derby Originals. This warranty covers manufacturing defects. Accidental damage or wear and tear is not covered. Contact the manufacturer for more information.</span></li>

<p data-mce-fragment="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">Please be aware that all Derby Originals slow feed hay nets are made by hand, and may have slight variation in overall size and the size of the openings. All measurements and capacities listed are approximate. The amount of hay that our hay nets can hold varies greatly due to the type of hay being fed, the dimensions of the hay bale, and the size of the hay flake.</span></p>

These sturdy hay nets are made from a durable poly rope that is long-lasting and is UV, mold, and mildew resistant. Our slow feed hay nets have been carefully designed to be comfortable for your horse to use and are great for daily individual and group feeding, use while trailering, and for soaking hay. Our hay nets are available in a wide array of sizes and colors so that you can find the perfect net for you and your horse!</span></p>
<br data-mce-fragment="1">
<p data-mce-fragment="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">Please be aware that all Derby Originals slow feed hay nets are made by hand, and may have slight variation in overall size and the size of the openings. All measurements and capacities listed are approximate. The amount of hay that our hay nets can hold varies greatly due to the type of hay being fed, the dimensions of the hay bale, and the size of the hay flake.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Derby Originals is the original inventor of the 4-sided hay bag, U.S. Patent No. D742,078. Our four-sided hay bags are the only bags on the market that allow your horse to freely eat from any part of the hay bag. These patented hay bags are the result of years of careful study and testing to create a design that is attractive, functional, durable, high-quality, and preferred by horses. Our bags are constructed of reinforced nylon webbing that is stronger and more durable than any mesh or fabric hay bag. These bags are designed with cross stitches at every intersection and bartack stitching at all stress points along the top, sides, and bottom of the bag. This hay bag also features our exclusive Super Tough Bottom®: a grid of reinforced nylon webbing that will never rip like solid or mesh bottoms. Our bags are built tough from premium materials and are designed to last for years to come. This hay bag is designed to be a great everyday feeder for most horses and other animals: it measures 19x19x41" and can hold 1 bale of hay. This hay bag has 1.75” square openings which will prevent hay wastage and slow down their rate of consumption, but still allow for frustration-free feeding. This premium hay bag also includes a 1-year limited manufacturer's warranty offered by Derby Originals.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">HOLDS 1 BALE OF HAY - this 19x19x41" hay bag with 1.75" square openings holds approx. 1 bale of Timothy, Orchard, Alfalfa, or any other type of hay. Our hay bags were designed to minimize frustration and can be stuffed in seconds.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">EXCLUSIVE PATENTED 4-SIDED CONSTRUCTION - this hay bag features Derby Originals patented nylon web design that allows your horse to eat from any part of the hay bag. This design eliminates the risk of material rips and tears found in other hay bags.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">SUPER TOUGH BOTTOM® DESIGN - our exclusive Super Tough Bottom® is made of reinforced overlapping nylon webbing. This design allows for superior strength and durability while keeping your hay fresh and allowing dust and debris to exit the bag.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">IMPROVES DIGESTION - horses are designed to spend up to 18 hours a day grazing. Slow feeding allows you to replicate this natural behavior and is recommended by veterinarians to prevent gastric ulcers, colic, and boredom-related behavioral vices.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">ONE YEAR WARRANTY - this hay bag has a 1-year limited manufacturer's warranty offered by Derby Originals. This warranty covers manufacturing defects. Accidental damage or wear and tear is not covered. Contact the manufacturer for more information.</span></li>

<p data-mce-fragment="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">Please be aware that all Derby Originals slow feed hay nets are made by hand, and may have slight variation in overall size and the size of the openings. All measurements and capacities listed are approximate. The amount of hay that our hay nets can hold varies greatly due to the type of hay being fed, the dimensions of the hay bale, and the size of the hay flake.</span></p>

<p data-mce-fragment="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">PREVENTS EXCESS HAY WASTAGE - our slow feed hay nets are designed to help you save money and reduce waste by over 50%. These hay nets prevent hay from being scattered or soiled which is beneficial to your horse's health as well as your wallet.</span></p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">IMPROVES YOUR HORSE'S DIGESTION - hay nets allow you to slow feed your horse, which mimics natural grazing patterns and is proven to aid the digestive process. Slow feeding is recommended by veterinarians to prevent gastric ulcers and colic.</span></p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">REDUCES BOREDOM - horses are designed to spend up to 16 hours a day grazing. Slow feeding replicates this natural behavior and keeps your horse occupied longer, which helps to prevent boredom-based bad behaviors such as chewing, cribbing, and pacing.</span></p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">DURABLE MULTI-PURPOSE DESIGN - our hay nets are made from a mold, mildew, and UV resistant poly rope that is resistant to breaking and tearing, making these nets ideal for daily individual and group feeding, use while trailering, and for soaking hay.</span></p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">HOLDS APPROX. 4-6 FLAKES - this slow feed hay net can hold about 4-6 flakes or up to a half of a 2-string or square bale of hay. These hay nets are great for everyday feeding and can be used in stalls, trailers, and pastures.</span></p></td>

    <td colspan="2"><p>This slow feed cover is for hay boxes. The cover has smaller openings to limit the rate that the horse consumes the hay. It has a metal frame to help the cover keep its shape. Most hay boxes come with a metal grid that can get hot in the summer and horses can accidentally hurt their teeth and gums on it. The cover made by Derby Originals is made from a durable nylon material that will not hurt your horse while eating.</p>
<ul>
<li>THREE OPENING SIZES – these hay box covers are available in 1.75×1.75”, 2×2”, and 1.75×3.5” hole styles to suit your needs and your horse’s feeding preferences.</li>
<li>HEAVY-DUTY CONSTRUCTION – with a strong metal frame and heavy-duty stitching on the double-ply nylon, this design is built to last and stand up to years of wear and tear from your horses.</li>
<li>STEEL FRAME SIZING – the cold-rolled steel frames measure 32" × 22.5”, which is large enough for most hay boxes and will allow for your horse to have plenty of hay.</li>
<li>A SAFER ALTERNATIVE – these hay box covers are made with a heavy-duty 1” wide double-ply nylon mesh. Regular metal hay box grates can cause severe tooth and gum damage over time, but with nylon, your horse’s mouth won’t get irritated or cut as they eat.</li>
<li>PERFECT FOR DIY PROJECTS – if you’re making your horse a DIY hay box, these grates are perfect to use because of their safe nylon design, the ability to use multiple grates for larger feeders, and the ability to mix and match or swap out opening sizes.</li>
</ul>
