When washing, use cool water and hand wash gently. Do not use fabric softener with any of our blankets as it will damage their waterproofing and breathing abilities and prevent the blanket from wicking water and sweat off your horse. All of our blankets should be air-dried or line-dried, never put in a dryer.

Do not use fabric softener with any of our blankets as it will damage their waterproofing and breathing abilities and prevent the blanket from wicking water and sweat off your horse. All of our blankets should be air-dried or line-dried, never put in a dryer. If your blanket becomes nicked or torn, the blanket should immediately be sewn or patched to prevent further damage from occurring.\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003c\/div\u003e","brand":"Derby Originals","offers":[{"title":"Electric Blue \/ 36\"","offer_id":31670426599484,"sku":"80-8023V2-EBL-36","price":64.99,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true},{"title":"Electric Blue \/ 38\"","offer_id":31670426632252,"sku":"80-8023V2-EBL-38","price":64.99,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true},{"title":"Electric Blue \/ 40\"","offer_id":31670426665020,"sku":"80-8023V2-EBL-40","price":64.99,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true},{"title":"Electric Blue \/ 42\"","offer_id":31670426697788,"sku":"80-8023V2-EBL-42","price":64.99,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true},{"title":"Electric Blue \/ 44\"","offer_id":31670426730556,"sku":"80-8023V2-EBL-44","price":64.99,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true},{"title":"Electric Blue \/ 46\"","offer_id":31670426763324,"sku":"80-8023V2-EBL-46","price":64.99,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":false},{"title":"Electric Blue \/ 48\"","offer_id":31670426796092,"sku":"80-8023V2-EBL-48","price":64.99,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":false},{"title":"Electric Blue \/ 50\"","offer_id":31670426828860,"sku":"80-8023V2-EBL-50","price":74.99,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":false},{"title":"Electric Blue \/ 52\"","offer_id":31670426861628,"sku":"80-8023V2-EBL-52","price":74.99,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true},{"title":"Electric Blue \/ 54\"","offer_id":31670426894396,"sku":"80-8023V2-EBL-54","price":74.99,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":false},{"title":"Electric Blue \/ 56\"","offer_id":31670426927164,"sku":"80-8023V2-EBL-56","price":74.99,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":false},{"title":"Electric Blue \/ 58\"","offer_id":31670426959932,"sku":"80-8023V2-EBL-58","price":74.99,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true},{"title":"Electric Blue \/ 60\"","offer_id":31670426992700,"sku":"80-8023V2-EBL-60","price":79.99,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true},{"title":"Electric Blue \/ 62\"","offer_id":31670427025468,"sku":"80-8023V2-EBL-62","price":79.99,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true},{"title":"Electric Blue \/ 64\"","offer_id":31670427058236,"sku":"80-8023V2-EBL-64","price":79.99,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true},{"title":"Red \/ 36\"","offer_id":31670425616444,"sku":"80-8023V2-RED-36","price":64.99,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true},{"title":"Red \/ 38\"","offer_id":31670425649212,"sku":"80-8023V2-RED-38","price":64.99,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true},{"title":"Red \/ 40\"","offer_id":31670425681980,"sku":"80-8023V2-RED-40","price":64.99,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true},{"title":"Red \/ 42\"","offer_id":31670425714748,"sku":"80-8023V2-RED-42","price":64.99,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true},{"title":"Red \/ 44\"","offer_id":31670425747516,"sku":"80-8023V2-RED-44","price":64.99,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true},{"title":"Red \/ 46\"","offer_id":31670425780284,"sku":"80-8023V2-RED-46","price":64.99,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":false},{"title":"Red \/ 48\"","offer_id":31670425813052,"sku":"80-8023V2-RED-48","price":64.99,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":false},{"title":"Red \/ 50\"","offer_id":31670425845820,"sku":"80-8023V2-RED-50","price":74.99,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":false},{"title":"Red \/ 52\"","offer_id":31670425878588,"sku":"80-8023V2-RED-52","price":74.99,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":false},{"title":"Red \/ 54\"","offer_id":31670425911356,"sku":"80-8023V2-RED-54","price":74.99,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":false},{"title":"Red \/ 56\"","offer_id":31670425944124,"sku":"80-8023V2-RED-56","price":74.99,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":false},{"title":"Red \/ 58\"","offer_id":31670425976892,"sku":"80-8023V2-RED-58","price":74.99,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true},{"title":"Red \/ 60\"","offer_id":31670426009660,"sku":"80-8023V2-RED-60","price":79.99,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true},{"title":"Red \/ 62\"","offer_id":31670426042428,"sku":"80-8023V2-RED-62","price":79.99,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true},{"title":"Red \/ 64\"","offer_id":31670426075196,"sku":"80-8023V2-RED-64","price":79.99,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true}],"thumbnail_url":"\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/1898\/9069\/products\/80-8023V2_Mini_Pony_Winter_Blanket_Both-Colors.jpg?v=1586366640"}],"url":"https:\/\/www.tackwholesale.com\/collections\/pony-blankets-sheets.oembed","provider":"Tack Wholesale","version":"1.0","type":"link"}
