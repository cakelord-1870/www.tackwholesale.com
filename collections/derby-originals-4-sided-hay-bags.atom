Our hay bags are the only hay bags on the market that allow your horse to eat freely from any side of the hay bag. Derby Originals holds the patent, U.S. Patent No. D742,078., for this innovative feature. Our brand is the world’s only brand with a completely open four-sided design that allows for optimum ease of feeding, air flow, preventing hay rot, and allowing for easy in-bag soaking. We are also proud to be the first company to offer a one year warranty on hay bags. Our patented hay bags are the result of years of careful study and testing with horses to create a design that is attractive, functional, durable, high-quality, and preferred by horses. Our hay bags are made of a strong 1200D double-layered nylon that is UV resistant, can withstand high temperatures, is mildew-resistant, and dries quickly. With a large line of size options, opening size options, colors, and styles, we have a patented hay bag designed to suit every horse!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">EXCLUSIVE PATENTED DESIGN - our patented four-sided design allows your horse to comfortably eat from any part of this hay bag while also offering superior airflow and allowing dust and debris to exit the hay without creating excess waste.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">HELPS TO SUPPORT GOOD DIGESTION - our hay bags replicate natural and healthy grazing patterns by slowing down your horse’s rate of hay consumption to both decrease hay waste and help prevent digestion issues such as potentially deadly colic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">HEAVY-DUTY CONSTRUCTION - our hay bag is made of super tough double-layered 1200D nylon and features premium hardware and straps and reinforced stitching that allows it to withstand whatever forces your horse exerts on it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">THE IDEAL SLOW FEEDER - this 46x26x12” hay bag features uniform 2” square openings which allow your horse to eat comfortably at a more natural pace that mimics grazing. Our hay bags are ideal for helping to prevent colic or digestive upset.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ONE YEAR LIMITED MANUFACTURER’S WARRANTY - this product comes with a one-year limited manufacturer's warranty that protects against manufacturing and quality defects. This warranty does not cover accidental damage.</span></p></td>

<p data-mce-fragment="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">Derby Originals is the original inventor of the 4-sided hay bag, U.S. Patent No. D742,078. Our four-sided hay bags are the only bags on the market that allow your horse to freely eat from any part of the hay bag. These patented hay bags are the result of years of careful study and testing to create a design that is attractive, functional, durable, high-quality, and preferred by horses. Our bags are constructed of reinforced nylon webbing that is stronger and more durable than any mesh or fabric hay bag. These bags are designed with cross stitches at every intersection and bartack stitching at all stress points along the top, sides, and bottom of the bag. This hay bag also features our exclusive Super Tough Bottom®: a grid of reinforced nylon webbing that will never rip like solid or mesh bottoms. Our bags are built tough from premium materials and are designed to last for years to come. This hay bag is designed to be a great everyday feeder for most horses and other animals: it measures 22x8x25" and can hold about 2-3 flakes of hay.
