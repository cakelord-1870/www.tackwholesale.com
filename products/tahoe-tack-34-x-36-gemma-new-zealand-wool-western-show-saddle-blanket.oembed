Never machine wash or dry your blanket. Instead, you should regularly clean it of dirt and fur by gently brushing it with a soft brush. Next, use a vacuum hose to remove any remaining debris from your blanket. Once your blanket is mostly clean, you can wash it with lukewarm to cold water and Woolite™ or specialty saddle pad cleaner to remove any further dirt and sweat. It's important that, after washing, you store your blanket properly on a rack without any tack on top of it to allow it to maintain its shape and thoroughly dry out.\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e","brand":"Tahoe Tack","offers":[{"title":"Black\/Orange\/Cream\/Turquoise\/White","offer_id":39343353692220,"sku":"61-3010-ORG","price":69.99,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true},{"title":"Black\/Dark Purple\/Light Purple\/White","offer_id":39343353724988,"sku":"61-3010-PUR","price":69.99,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":false},{"title":"Black\/Red\/Grey\/Tan\/White","offer_id":39343353757756,"sku":"61-3010-RED","price":69.99,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":false},{"title":"Black\/Tan\/Turquoise\/Gold\/White","offer_id":39343353790524,"sku":"61-3010-TAN","price":69.99,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true}],"thumbnail_url":"\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/1898\/9069\/products\/1Gemma_Diamond_Cross_Western_Saddle_Pad_Blanket_Swatch_61-3010-ORG.png?v=1628864164","url":"https:\/\/www.tackwholesale.com\/products\/tahoe-tack-34-x-36-gemma-new-zealand-wool-western-show-saddle-blanket","provider":"Tack Wholesale","version":"1.0","type":"link"}
