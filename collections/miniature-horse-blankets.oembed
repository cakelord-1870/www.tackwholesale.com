A stiff dandy brush often works best for this. Keeping your blanket clean helps extend its lifespan, as well as help to keep your horse clean and happy. You can also use a damp, soapy rag to remove mud\/debris and then wipe your blanket dry. Fleece blankets should only be hand washed and never machine washed. All removable parts should be removed before washing, all velcro straps velcroed together, and your blanket should only be washed in a detergent made for use with horse blankets, or gentle animal-safe cleaners. When washing, use cool water and hand wash gently. Do not use fabric softener with any of our blankets as it will damage their waterproofing and breathing abilities and prevent the blanket from wicking water and sweat off your horse. All of our blankets should be air-dried or line-dried, never put in a dryer. If your blanket becomes nicked or torn, the blanket should immediately be sewn or patched to prevent further damage from occurring.\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e","brand":"Derby

Originals Reflective Safety Winter Blanket for Foals are a better and more modern solution to outdated foal blanket designs. Our foal blanket features a pair of adjustable double-velcro chest straps that allow for the blanket to be adjusted to fit smaller or larger foals. These chest straps are elastic to allow for a more comfortable and snug fit, which helps keep your foal safe and from becoming tangled. This blanket also features matching elastic double-velcro belly straps for the best possible fit. All four chest and belly straps are covered in reflective tape to greatly increase visibility and help keep your foal safe outside or in the pasture. We're proud to be the original inventor of the hardware free foal blanket, which has no metal parts to increase your foal's comfort and safety. Our innovative blanket also has a pair of adjust-to-fit neck-straps to allow for a better fit around the neck opening. Our blankets come with an oversized tail cover that is held in place with 3 sturdy velcro tabs and can be removed and replaced as needed. Our blankets are made of 600D, ripstop, waterproof, windproof, and snowproof nylon, which is durable and designed for indoor and outdoor use. This blanket has 150 grams of PolyFil filling, which is designed to keep your foal warm without overheating in temperatures down to 10° F. Our blankets have been designed with care to last and keep your foals comfortable and are backed by a one-year limited warranty.\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cbr data-mce-fragment=\"1\"\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eDESIGNED TO GROW WITH YOUR FOAL - our safety blankets have adjustable straps and elastic on the chest and belly straps to allow for the best fit possible.

A stiff dandy brush often works best for this. Keeping your blanket clean helps extend its lifespan, as well as help to keep your horse clean and happy. You can also use a damp, soapy rag to remove mud\/debris and then wipe your blanket dry. Fleece blankets should only be hand washed and never machine washed. All removable parts should be removed before washing, all velcro straps velcroed together, and your blanket should only be washed in a detergent made for use with horse blankets, or gentle animal-safe cleaners. When washing, use cool water and hand wash gently. Do not use fabric softener with any of our blankets as it will damage their waterproofing and breathing abilities and prevent the blanket from wicking water and sweat off your horse. All of our blankets should be air-dried or line-dried, never put in a dryer. If your blanket becomes nicked or torn, the blanket should immediately be sewn or patched to prevent further damage from occurring.\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/div\u003e","brand":"Derby

A stiff dandy brush often works best for this. Keeping your blanket clean helps extend its lifespan, as well as help to keep your horse clean and happy. You can also use a damp, soapy rag to remove mud\/debris and then wipe your blanket dry. Fleece blankets should only be hand washed and never machine washed. All removable parts should be removed before washing, all velcro straps velcroed together, and your blanket should only be washed in a detergent made for use with horse blankets, or gentle animal-safe cleaners. When washing, use cool water and hand wash gently. Do not use fabric softener with any of our blankets as it will damage their waterproofing and breathing abilities and prevent the blanket from wicking water and sweat off your horse. All of our blankets should be air-dried or line-dried, never put in a dryer. If your blanket becomes nicked or torn, the blanket should immediately be sewn or patched to prevent further damage from occurring.\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003c\/div\u003e","brand":"Derby Originals","offers":[{"title":"Electric Blue \/ 36\"","offer_id":31670426599484,"sku":"80-8023V2-EBL-36","price":64.99,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true},{"title":"Electric Blue \/ 38\"","offer_id":31670426632252,"sku":"80-8023V2-EBL-38","price":64.99,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true},{"title":"Electric Blue \/ 40\"","offer_id":31670426665020,"sku":"80-8023V2-EBL-40","price":64.99,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true},{"title":"Electric Blue \/ 42\"","offer_id":31670426697788,"sku":"80-8023V2-EBL-42","price":64.99,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true},{"title":"Electric Blue \/ 44\"","offer_id":31670426730556,"sku":"80-8023V2-EBL-44","price":64.99,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true},{"title":"Electric Blue \/ 46\"","offer_id":31670426763324,"sku":"80-8023V2-EBL-46","price":64.99,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":false},{"title":"Electric Blue \/ 48\"","offer_id":31670426796092,"sku":"80-8023V2-EBL-48","price":64.99,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":false},{"title":"Electric Blue \/ 50\"","offer_id":31670426828860,"sku":"80-8023V2-EBL-50","price":74.99,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":false},{"title":"Electric Blue \/ 52\"","offer_id":31670426861628,"sku":"80-8023V2-EBL-52","price":74.99,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true},{"title":"Electric Blue \/ 54\"","offer_id":31670426894396,"sku":"80-8023V2-EBL-54","price":74.99,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":false},{"title":"Electric Blue \/ 56\"","offer_id":31670426927164,"sku":"80-8023V2-EBL-56","price":74.99,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":false},{"title":"Electric Blue \/ 58\"","offer_id":31670426959932,"sku":"80-8023V2-EBL-58","price":74.99,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true},{"title":"Electric Blue \/ 60\"","offer_id":31670426992700,"sku":"80-8023V2-EBL-60","price":79.99,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true},{"title":"Electric Blue \/ 62\"","offer_id":31670427025468,"sku":"80-8023V2-EBL-62","price":79.99,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true},{"title":"Electric Blue \/ 64\"","offer_id":31670427058236,"sku":"80-8023V2-EBL-64","price":79.99,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true},{"title":"Red \/ 36\"","offer_id":31670425616444,"sku":"80-8023V2-RED-36","price":64.99,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true},{"title":"Red \/ 38\"","offer_id":31670425649212,"sku":"80-8023V2-RED-38","price":64.99,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true},{"title":"Red \/ 40\"","offer_id":31670425681980,"sku":"80-8023V2-RED-40","price":64.99,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true},{"title":"Red \/ 42\"","offer_id":31670425714748,"sku":"80-8023V2-RED-42","price":64.99,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true},{"title":"Red \/ 44\"","offer_id":31670425747516,"sku":"80-8023V2-RED-44","price":64.99,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true},{"title":"Red \/ 46\"","offer_id":31670425780284,"sku":"80-8023V2-RED-46","price":64.99,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":false},{"title":"Red \/ 48\"","offer_id":31670425813052,"sku":"80-8023V2-RED-48","price":64.99,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":false},{"title":"Red \/ 50\"","offer_id":31670425845820,"sku":"80-8023V2-RED-50","price":74.99,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":false},{"title":"Red \/ 52\"","offer_id":31670425878588,"sku":"80-8023V2-RED-52","price":74.99,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":false},{"title":"Red \/ 54\"","offer_id":31670425911356,"sku":"80-8023V2-RED-54","price":74.99,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":false},{"title":"Red \/ 56\"","offer_id":31670425944124,"sku":"80-8023V2-RED-56","price":74.99,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":false},{"title":"Red \/ 58\"","offer_id":31670425976892,"sku":"80-8023V2-RED-58","price":74.99,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true},{"title":"Red \/ 60\"","offer_id":31670426009660,"sku":"80-8023V2-RED-60","price":79.99,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true},{"title":"Red \/ 62\"","offer_id":31670426042428,"sku":"80-8023V2-RED-62","price":79.99,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true},{"title":"Red \/ 64\"","offer_id":31670426075196,"sku":"80-8023V2-RED-64","price":79.99,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true}],"thumbnail_url":"\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/1898\/9069\/products\/80-8023V2_Mini_Pony_Winter_Blanket_Both-Colors.jpg?v=1586366640"}],"url":"https:\/\/www.tackwholesale.com\/collections\/miniature-horse-blankets.oembed","provider":"Tack Wholesale","version":"1.0","type":"link"}
