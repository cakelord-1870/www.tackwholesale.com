A stiff dandy brush often works best for this. Keeping your blanket clean helps extend its lifespan, as well as help to keep your horse clean and happy. You can also use a damp, soapy rag to remove mud\/debris and then wipe your blanket dry. Fleece blankets should only be hand washed and never machine washed. All removable parts should be removed before washing, all velcro straps velcroed together, and your blanket should only be washed in a detergent made for use with horse blankets, or gentle animal-safe cleaners. When washing, use cool water and hand wash gently. Do not use fabric softener with any of our blankets as it will damage their waterproofing and breathing abilities and prevent the blanket from wicking water and sweat off your horse. All of our blankets should be air-dried or line-dried, never put in a dryer. If your blanket becomes nicked or torn, the blanket should immediately be sewn or patched to prevent further damage from occurring.\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eProduct Information\u003c\/b\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eBlanket Style: Summer Sheet\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eWaterproof: No\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eBreathable: Yes\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eWeight: Lightweight\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eMaterial: Cotton\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eDenier: n\/a\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eRipstop: No\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eTail Cover: No\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eWither Protector: Yes\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eShoulder Gussets: Yes\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003ePolyfil: 0g\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eInner Lining: Cotton\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eBelly Closure: Belly Surgincle\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eLeg Straps: Removable Elastic\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eColors Available: Hunter Green\/Beige Plaid\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eSizes Available: 72”, 74”, 76”, 78”, 80”, 82”, and 84”\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cul class=\"product-features-list\"\u003e\u003c\/ul\u003e","brand":"Derby Originals","offers":[{"title":"72\"","offer_id":29253462982716,"sku":"80-8005HB-72","price":39.99,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":false},{"title":"74\"","offer_id":29253471567932,"sku":"80-8005HB-74","price":39.99,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true},{"title":"76\"","offer_id":29253471600700,"sku":"80-8005HB-76","price":39.99,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":false},{"title":"78\"","offer_id":29253471633468,"sku":"80-8005HB-78","price":39.99,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":false},{"title":"80\"","offer_id":29253471666236,"sku":"80-8005HB-80","price":39.99,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true},{"title":"82\"","offer_id":29253471699004,"sku":"80-8005HB-82","price":39.99,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true},{"title":"84\"","offer_id":29253471731772,"sku":"80-8005HB-84","price":39.99,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":false}],"thumbnail_url":"\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/1898\/9069\/products\/derby-orginals-plaid-sheet-_Main_80-8005.jpg?v=1597159279"},{"product_id":"derby-originals-mesh-belly-band-reflective-fly-sheet","title":"Derby Originals Mesh Belly Band Reflective Trim Horse Fly Sheet","description":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eDerby Originals’ premium mesh bellyband fly sheet was designed with your horse’s comfort and safety in mind.
