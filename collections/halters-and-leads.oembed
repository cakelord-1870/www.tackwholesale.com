These unique and modern tack pieces feature innovative and elegant Rose Gold and Blackout nickel-plated hardware that is unlike anything else offered before. Our hardware is not only breathtaking in its beauty and quality but was designed to hold up strong for long-term use. Derby Originals Desert Rose Collection was designed to emulate the colors, feel, and beauty of the American Southwest in every stunning detail. We meticulously designed these Desert Rose halters and leads right here in the U.S.A. and are proud to be able to stand behind our products and offer a one year warranty on these products. Derby Originals’ Desert Rose Collection halters are available in two styles, stable halters that feature an adjustable nylon crown, and breakaway halters which feature modern and innovative Flex-Webb crowns. These crowns are designed to provide the safety breakaway benefits of a traditional leather crown, without needing special care, regular cleaning, or eventually deteriorating over time like leather will. These gorgeous halters are available in five colors inspired by the natural landscape of the American desert: Midnight Black, Cactus Green, Coral, Red Sand, and Turquoise. Derby Originals line of Desert Rose halters are also available in four sizes: Miniature Horse, Cob\/Arab, Full Horse, and Oversize\/Warmblood, which means our halters will fit almost any equine. Please be aware when reading past reviews (before October 2020) that we experienced a small quality issue with our lead ropes where they wore quickly. This was quickly corrected and fixed and this issue has been totally eradicated. We are providing full warranty coverage for any issues previous buyers experienced.
