<p data-mce-fragment="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">Derby Originals Reflective Safety Winter Blanket for Foals are a better and more modern solution to outdated foal blanket designs. Our foal blanket features a pair of adjustable double-velcro chest straps that allow for the blanket to be adjusted to fit smaller or larger foals. These chest straps are elastic to allow for a more comfortable and snug fit, which helps keep your foal safe and from becoming tangled. This blanket also features matching elastic double-velcro belly straps for the best possible fit. All four chest and belly straps are covered in reflective tape to greatly increase visibility and help keep your foal safe outside or in the pasture. We're proud to be the original inventor of the hardware free foal blanket, which has no metal parts to increase your foal's comfort and safety. Our innovative blanket also has a pair of adjust-to-fit neck-straps to allow for a better fit around the neck opening. Our blankets come with an oversized tail cover that is held in place with 3 sturdy velcro tabs and can be removed and replaced as needed. Our blankets are made of 1200D, ripstop, waterproof, windproof, and snowproof nylon, which is durable and designed for indoor and outdoor use. This blanket has 150 grams of PolyFil filling, which is designed to keep your foal warm without overheating in temperatures down to 10° F. Our blankets have been designed with care to last and keep your foals comfortable and are backed by a two-year limited warranty.</span></p>

Our blankets can adjust by 6" so they fit your foal for longer and can fit multiple foals.</span></p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">NO HARDWARE DESIGN KEEPS YOUR FOAL SAFE - this blanket is metal-free for increased safety.

<p data-mce-fragment="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">Derby Originals Reflective Safety Winter Blanket for Foals are a better and more modern solution to outdated foal blanket designs. Our foal blanket features a pair of adjustable double-velcro chest straps that allow for the blanket to be adjusted to fit smaller or larger foals. These chest straps are elastic to allow for a more comfortable and snug fit, which helps keep your foal safe and from becoming tangled. This blanket also features matching elastic double-velcro belly straps for the best possible fit. All four chest and belly straps are covered in reflective tape to greatly increase visibility and help keep your foal safe outside or in the pasture. We're proud to be the original inventor of the hardware free foal blanket, which has no metal parts to increase your foal's comfort and safety. Our innovative blanket also has a pair of adjust-to-fit neck-straps to allow for a better fit around the neck opening. Our blankets come with an oversized tail cover that is held in place with 3 sturdy velcro tabs and can be removed and replaced as needed. Our blankets are made of 600D, ripstop, waterproof, windproof, and snowproof nylon, which is durable and designed for indoor and outdoor use. This blanket has 150 grams of PolyFil filling, which is designed to keep your foal warm without overheating in temperatures down to 10° F. Our blankets have been designed with care to last and keep your foals comfortable and are backed by a one-year limited warranty.</span></p>

<li><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">DESIGNED TO GROW WITH YOUR FOAL - our safety blankets have adjustable straps and elastic on the chest and belly straps to allow for the best fit possible. Our blankets can adjust by 6" so they fit your foal for longer and can fit multiple foals.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">NO HARDWARE DESIGN KEEPS YOUR FOAL SAFE - this blanket is metal-free for increased safety. This, combined with other features such as a reflective design, adjustable neck straps, and a padded belly band, increases both your foal's safety and comfort.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">AVAILABLE IN THREE SIZES - our foal blankets are available in three sizes to fit most Small, Medium, and Large foals. Size Small is recommended for most newborn foals. Sizes Medium and Large will also fit most mini horses as well as larger foals.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">SIZING RECOMMENDATIONS FOR MINIS - Please note that the back length and belly straps are shorter as these blankets are meant to fit foals. We do not recommend the size Small for any mini horse, only sizes Medium and Large, and recommend sizing up.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">1 YEAR LIMITED MANUFACTURER'S WARRANTY - this product is eligible for a 1-year warranty that protects against manufacturing defects.
