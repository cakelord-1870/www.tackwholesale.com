A stiff dandy brush often works best for this. Keeping your blanket clean helps extend its lifespan, as well as help to keep your horse clean and happy. You can also use a damp, soapy rag to remove mud\/debris and then wipe your blanket dry. Fleece blankets should only be hand washed and never machine washed. All removable parts should be removed before washing, all velcro straps velcroed together, and your blanket should only be washed in a detergent made for use with horse blankets, or gentle animal-safe cleaners. When washing, use cool water and hand wash gently. Do not use fabric softener with any of our blankets as it will damage their waterproofing and breathing abilities and prevent the blanket from wicking water and sweat off your horse. All of our blankets should be air-dried or line-dried, never put in a dryer.

A stiff dandy brush often works best for this. Keeping your blanket clean helps extend its lifespan, as well as help to keep your horse clean and happy. You can also use a damp, soapy rag to remove mud\/debris and then wipe your blanket dry. Fleece blankets should only be hand washed and never machine washed. All removable parts should be removed before washing, all velcro straps velcroed together, and your blanket should only be washed in a detergent made for use with horse blankets, or gentle animal-safe cleaners. When washing, use cool water and hand wash gently. Do not use fabric softener with any of our blankets as it will damage their waterproofing and breathing abilities and prevent the blanket from wicking water and sweat off your horse. All of our blankets should be air-dried or line-dried, never put in a dryer. If your blanket becomes nicked or torn, the blanket should immediately be sewn or patched to prevent further damage from occurring.\u003c\/span\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eProduct Information:\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eBlanket Style: Turnout\/Rain Sheet\u003cbr\u003e\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eWaterproof: Yes\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eBreathable: Yes\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eWeight: Light Weight\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eMaterial: 1200D Ripstop Nylon\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003ePolyfil: 0g\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eInner Lining: 210T Nylon\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003c\/ul\u003e","brand":"Derby Originals","offers":[{"title":"Orange \/ 69\"","offer_id":21271269277756,"sku":"80-8046OR-69","price":79.99,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true},{"title":"Orange \/ 72\"","offer_id":21271269343292,"sku":"80-8046OR-72","price":79.99,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true},{"title":"Orange \/ 75\"","offer_id":21271269408828,"sku":"80-8046OR-75","price":79.99,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true},{"title":"Orange \/ 78\"","offer_id":21271269474364,"sku":"80-8046OR-78","price":79.99,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true},{"title":"Orange \/ 81\"","offer_id":21271269539900,"sku":"80-8046OR-81","price":79.99,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true},{"title":"Orange \/ 84\"","offer_id":21271269605436,"sku":"80-8046OR-84","price":79.99,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":false},{"title":"Orange \/ 92\"","offer_id":21271269703740,"sku":"80-8046OR-92","price":89.99,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":false},{"title":"Orange \/ 96\"","offer_id":21271269769276,"sku":"80-8046OR-96","price":89.99,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":false},{"title":"Orange \/ 100\"","offer_id":21271269834812,"sku":"80-8046OR-100","price":89.99,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":false},{"title":"Red \/ 69\"","offer_id":21271269310524,"sku":"80-8046RD-69","price":79.99,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true},{"title":"Red \/ 72\"","offer_id":21271269376060,"sku":"80-8046RD-72","price":79.99,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true},{"title":"Red \/ 75\"","offer_id":21271269441596,"sku":"80-8046RD-75","price":79.99,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true},{"title":"Red \/ 78\"","offer_id":21271269507132,"sku":"80-8046RD-78","price":79.99,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true},{"title":"Red \/ 81\"","offer_id":21271269572668,"sku":"80-8046RD-81","price":79.99,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true},{"title":"Red \/ 84\"","offer_id":21271269638204,"sku":"80-8046RD-84","price":79.99,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true},{"title":"Red \/ 90\"","offer_id":21271269670972,"sku":"80-8046RD-90","price":89.99,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":false},{"title":"Red \/ 92\"","offer_id":21271269736508,"sku":"80-8046RD-92","price":89.99,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":false},{"title":"Red \/ 96\"","offer_id":21271269802044,"sku":"80-8046RD-96","price":89.99,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":false},{"title":"Red \/ 100\"","offer_id":21271269867580,"sku":"80-8046RD-100","price":89.99,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":false}],"thumbnail_url":"\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/1898\/9069\/products\/Horse_Blanket_1200D_Ripstop_Windstorm_Red_Swatch_80-8046.jpg?v=1592591547"},{"product_id":"derby-originals-comfort-stretch-lycra-sleazy-full-body-sheet","title":"Derby Originals Comfy Stretch Lycra Sleazy Slicker Body Sheet with Belly Band","description":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eDerby Originals Comfy Stretch Lycra Sleazy Slicker Body Sheet with Belly Band is designed to be the ideal multi-purpose stretchable lycra spandex sheet.
