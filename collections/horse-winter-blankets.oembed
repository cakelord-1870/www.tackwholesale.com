A stiff dandy brush often works best for this. Keeping your blanket clean helps extend its lifespan, as well as help to keep your horse clean and happy. You can also use a damp, soapy rag to remove mud\/debris and then wipe your blanket dry. Fleece blankets should only be hand washed and never machine washed. All removable parts should be removed before washing, all velcro straps velcroed together, and your blanket should only be washed in a detergent made for use with horse blankets, or gentle animal-safe cleaners. When washing, use cool water and hand wash gently. Do not use fabric softener with any of our blankets as it will damage their waterproofing and breathing abilities and prevent the blanket from wicking water and sweat off your horse. All of our blankets should be air-dried or line-dried, never put in a dryer. If your blanket becomes nicked or torn, the blanket should immediately be sewn or patched to prevent further damage from occurring.\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp style=\"display: inline !important;\"\u003e\u003cb\u003eSizing Information\u003c\/b\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThis stable blanket is sized in the same manner that you will size any other horse blanket: by measuring, in inches, from the center of your horse’s chest to the end of your horse’s rump.

A stiff dandy brush often works best for this. Keeping your blanket clean helps extend its lifespan, as well as help to keep your horse clean and happy. You can also use a damp, soapy rag to remove mud\/debris and then wipe your blanket dry. Fleece blankets should only be hand washed and never machine washed. All removable parts should be removed before washing, all velcro straps velcroed together, and your blanket should only be washed in a detergent made for use with horse blankets, or gentle animal-safe cleaners. When washing, use cool water and hand wash gently. Do not use fabric softener with any of our blankets as it will damage their waterproofing and breathing abilities and prevent the blanket from wicking water and sweat off your horse. All of our blankets should be air-dried or line-dried, never put in a dryer. If your blanket becomes nicked or torn, the blanket should immediately be sewn or patched to prevent further damage from occurring.\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e","brand":"Derby Originals","offers":[{"title":"Purple \/ 36\"","offer_id":38759203536,"sku":"80-8042-PR-36","price":59.95,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":false},{"title":"Purple \/ 40\"","offer_id":38759203664,"sku":"80-8042-PR-40","price":59.95,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":false},{"title":"Purple \/ 42\"","offer_id":38759203920,"sku":"80-8042-PR-42","price":64.95,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":false},{"title":"Purple \/ 44\"","offer_id":38759204048,"sku":"80-8042-PR-44","price":64.95,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":false},{"title":"Purple \/ 46\"","offer_id":38759204368,"sku":"80-8042-PR-46","price":64.95,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":false},{"title":"Purple \/ 48\"","offer_id":38759204496,"sku":"80-8042-PR-48","price":64.95,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":false},{"title":"Turquoise \/ 36\"","offer_id":38759204240,"sku":"80-8042-TQ-36","price":59.95,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":false},{"title":"Turquoise \/ 40\"","offer_id":38759204624,"sku":"80-8042-TQ-40","price":59.95,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":false},{"title":"Turquoise \/ 42\"","offer_id":38759204752,"sku":"80-8042-TQ-42","price":64.95,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":false},{"title":"Turquoise \/ 44\"","offer_id":38759204880,"sku":"80-8042-TQ-44","price":64.95,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":false},{"title":"Turquoise \/ 46\"","offer_id":38759205008,"sku":"80-8042-TQ-46","price":64.95,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":false},{"title":"Turquoise \/ 48\"","offer_id":38759205136,"sku":"80-8042-TQ-48","price":64.95,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":false}],"thumbnail_url":"\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/1898\/9069\/products\/derby_originals_extreme_1200D_waterproof_pony_mini_horse_turnout_blanket_main_blue_80-8042.jpg?v=1588611738"},{"product_id":"80-8096","title":"Set of 2 Horse Blanket Surcingle Repair for Blankets Hardware Kit","description":"Use this handy kit to repair your broken blanket straps.

You can also use a damp, soapy rag to remove mud\/debris and then wipe your blanket dry. Fleece blankets should only be hand washed and never machine washed. All removable parts should be removed before washing, all velcro straps velcroed together, and your blanket should only be washed in a detergent made for use with horse blankets, or gentle animal-safe cleaners. When washing, use cool water and hand wash gently. Do not use fabric softener with any of our blankets as it will damage their waterproofing and breathing abilities and prevent the blanket from wicking water and sweat off your horse.

A stiff dandy brush often works best for this. Keeping your blanket clean helps extend its lifespan, as well as help to keep your horse clean and happy. You can also use a damp, soapy rag to remove mud\/debris and then wipe your blanket dry. Fleece blankets should only be hand washed and never machine washed. All removable parts should be removed before washing, all velcro straps velcroed together, and your blanket should only be washed in a detergent made for use with horse blankets, or gentle animal-safe cleaners. When washing, use cool water and hand wash gently. Do not use fabric softener with any of our blankets as it will damage their waterproofing and breathing abilities and prevent the blanket from wicking water and sweat off your horse. All of our blankets should be air-dried or line-dried, never put in a dryer. If your blanket becomes nicked or torn, the blanket should immediately be sewn or patched to prevent further damage from occurring.\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eSizing Information: to size this blanket, measure (in inches) from the center of your horse’s chest, to the end of your horse’s rump.

A stiff dandy brush often works best for this. Keeping your blanket clean helps extend its lifespan, as well as help to keep your horse clean and happy. You can also use a damp, soapy rag to remove mud\/debris and then wipe your blanket dry. Fleece blankets should only be hand washed and never machine washed. All removable parts should be removed before washing, all velcro straps velcroed together, and your blanket should only be washed in a detergent made for use with horse blankets, or gentle animal-safe cleaners. When washing, use cool water and hand wash gently. Do not use fabric softener with any of our blankets as it will damage their waterproofing and breathing abilities and prevent the blanket from wicking water and sweat off your horse. All of our blankets should be air-dried or line-dried, never put in a dryer. If your blanket becomes nicked or torn, the blanket should immediately be sewn or patched to prevent further damage from occurring.\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e","brand":"Derby

Our foal blanket features a pair of adjustable double-velcro chest straps that allow for the blanket to be adjusted to fit smaller or larger foals. These chest straps are elastic to allow for a more comfortable and snug fit, which helps keep your foal safe and from becoming tangled. This blanket also features matching elastic double-velcro belly straps for the best possible fit. All four chest and belly straps are covered in reflective tape to greatly increase visibility and help keep your foal safe outside or in the pasture. We're proud to be the original inventor of the hardware free foal blanket, which has no metal parts to increase your foal's comfort and safety. Our innovative blanket also has a pair of adjust-to-fit neck-straps to allow for a better fit around the neck opening. Our blankets come with an oversized tail cover that is held in place with 3 sturdy velcro tabs and can be removed and replaced as needed. Our blankets are made of 600D, ripstop, waterproof, windproof, and snowproof nylon, which is durable and designed for indoor and outdoor use. This blanket has 150 grams of PolyFil filling, which is designed to keep your foal warm without overheating in temperatures down to 10° F. Our blankets have been designed with care to last and keep your foals comfortable and are backed by a one-year limited warranty.\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cbr data-mce-fragment=\"1\"\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eDESIGNED TO GROW WITH YOUR FOAL - our safety blankets have adjustable straps and elastic on the chest and belly straps to allow for the best fit possible.

Our fleece sheet features a pair of adjustable double-velcro chest straps that allow for the blanket to be adjusted to fit smaller or larger foals. These chest straps are elastic to allow for a more comfortable and snug fit, which helps keep your foal safe and from becoming tangled. This sheet also features matching elastic double-velcro belly straps for the best possible fit. All four chest and belly straps are covered in reflective tape to greatly increase visibility and help keep your foal safe outside or in the pasture. We're proud to be the original inventor of the hardware free foal blanket, which has no metal parts to increase your foal's comfort and safety. Our innovative sheet also has a pair of adjust-to-fit neck-straps to allow for a better fit around the neck opening. Our sheets are made from warm and soft polar fleece, which is comfortable to wear and helps to regulate your foal’s temperature to prevent chilling or overheating all year round. Our fleece sheets are also designed to be moisture-wicking and are great for keeping sweat and water off your foal. They’re great for drying your foal off after a bath! Our sheets are multipurpose and can function as an all-season blanket, blanket liner, or cooler. These sheets are available in three attractive colors so you can find the perfect blanket to suit your new foal: Royal Blue, Red, and Navy Blue.\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eDESIGNED TO GROW WITH YOUR FOAL - our safety blankets have adjustable straps and elastic on the chest and belly straps to allow for the best fit possible.

A stiff dandy brush often works best for this. Keeping your blanket clean helps extend its lifespan, as well as help to keep your horse clean and happy. You can also use a damp, soapy rag to remove mud\/debris and then wipe your blanket dry. Fleece blankets should only be hand washed and never machine washed. All removable parts should be removed before washing, all velcro straps velcroed together, and your blanket should only be washed in a detergent made for use with horse blankets, or gentle animal-safe cleaners. When washing, use cool water and hand wash gently. Do not use fabric softener with any of our blankets as it will damage their waterproofing and breathing abilities and prevent the blanket from wicking water and sweat off your horse. All of our blankets should be air-dried or line-dried, never put in a dryer. If your blanket becomes nicked or torn, the blanket should immediately be sewn or patched to prevent further damage from occurring.\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/div\u003e","brand":"Derby
