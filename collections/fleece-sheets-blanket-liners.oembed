Instead, they're commonly used after a long ride, workout, or a bath to help prevent chills. Coolers are designed with breathable, moisture-wicking materials such as fleece or cotton and work by wicking moisture such as sweat or water away from your horse to speed the drying process. Blanket liners are often very similar to or the same design as coolers and can be used under blankets to provide an extra layer or warmth or to help wick moisture and sweat away from the horse.\u003c\/p\u003e","products":[{"product_id":"80-4033","title":"Derby Originals Fleece Cooler for Horses All Season Sheet \u0026 Blanket Liner with Neck Cover","description":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eDerby Originals Fleece Cooler for Horses All Season Sheet \u0026amp; Blanket Liner with Neck Cover is an excellent and affordable option for the horse owner looking for a lightweight, breathable, moisture-wicking, and comfortable sheet that is ideal in all seasons and extremely versatile.
