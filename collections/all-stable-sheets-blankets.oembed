A stiff dandy brush often works best for this. Keeping your blanket clean helps extend its lifespan, as well as help to keep your horse clean and happy. You can also use a damp, soapy rag to remove mud\/debris and then wipe your blanket dry. Fleece blankets should only be hand washed and never machine washed. All removable parts should be removed before washing, all velcro straps velcroed together, and your blanket should only be washed in a detergent made for use with horse blankets, or gentle animal-safe cleaners. When washing, use cool water and hand wash gently. Do not use fabric softener with any of our blankets as it will damage their waterproofing and breathing abilities and prevent the blanket from wicking water and sweat off your horse. All of our blankets should be air-dried or line-dried, never put in a dryer. If your blanket becomes nicked or torn, the blanket should immediately be sewn or patched to prevent further damage from occurring.\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eProduct Information\u003c\/b\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eBlanket Style: Summer Sheet\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eWaterproof: No\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eBreathable: Yes\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eWeight: Lightweight\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eMaterial: Cotton\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eDenier: n\/a\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eRipstop: No\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eTail Cover: No\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eWither Protector: Yes\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eShoulder Gussets: Yes\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003ePolyfil: 0g\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eInner Lining: Cotton\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eBelly Closure: Belly Surgincle\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eLeg Straps: Removable Elastic\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eColors Available: Hunter Green\/Beige Plaid\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eSizes Available: 72”, 74”, 76”, 78”, 80”, 82”, and 84”\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cul class=\"product-features-list\"\u003e\u003c\/ul\u003e","brand":"Derby Originals","offers":[{"title":"72\"","offer_id":29253462982716,"sku":"80-8005HB-72","price":39.99,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":false},{"title":"74\"","offer_id":29253471567932,"sku":"80-8005HB-74","price":39.99,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true},{"title":"76\"","offer_id":29253471600700,"sku":"80-8005HB-76","price":39.99,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":false},{"title":"78\"","offer_id":29253471633468,"sku":"80-8005HB-78","price":39.99,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":false},{"title":"80\"","offer_id":29253471666236,"sku":"80-8005HB-80","price":39.99,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true},{"title":"82\"","offer_id":29253471699004,"sku":"80-8005HB-82","price":39.99,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true},{"title":"84\"","offer_id":29253471731772,"sku":"80-8005HB-84","price":39.99,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":false}],"thumbnail_url":"\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/1898\/9069\/products\/derby-orginals-plaid-sheet-_Main_80-8005.jpg?v=1597159279"},{"product_id":"80-8075","title":"Derby Originals Breathable Wool Lined 18oz Canvas Triple Gusset Sheet for Horses","description":"\u003cp data-mce-fragment=\"1\"\u003e \u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp data-mce-fragment=\"1\"\u003e\u003cspan data-mce-fragment=\"1\"\u003eThis heavy canvas sheet is great for keeping your horse clean at a show or as a liner under a winter blanket. This sheet is breathable and comfortable for your horse to wear.\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp data-mce-fragment=\"1\"\u003e\u003cspan data-mce-fragment=\"1\"\u003eThis item has been discontinued and is on a closeout sale.

Our foal blankets feature a pair of adjustable double-velcro chest straps that allow for the blanket to be adjusted to fit smaller or larger foals. These chest straps are elastic to allow for a more comfortable and snug fit, which helps keep your foal safe and from becoming tangled. This blanket also features matching elastic double-velcro belly straps for the best possible fit. All four chest and belly straps are covered in reflective tape to greatly increase visibility and help keep your foal safe outside or in the pasture. We're proud to be the original inventor of the hardware free foal blanket, which has no metal parts to increase your foal's comfort and safety. Our innovative blanket also has a pair of adjust-to-fit neck-straps to allow for a better fit around the neck opening. Our blankets come with an oversized tail cover that is held in place with 3 sturdy velcro tabs and can be removed and replaced as needed. Our blankets are made of 420D water-resistant, windproof, breathable nylon, which is designed for premium comfort indoors. This blanket has 150 grams of PolyFil filling, which is designed to keep your foal warm without overheating in temperatures down to 10° F. This blanket is available in three fun colors so you can find the perfect blanket to best suit your new foal: Coral, Charcoal, and Hurricane Blue.\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cbr data-mce-fragment=\"1\"\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eDESIGNED TO GROW WITH YOUR FOAL - our safety blankets have adjustable straps and elastic on the chest and belly straps to allow for the best fit possible.
