Never machine wash or dry your blanket. Instead, you should regularly clean it of dirt and fur by gently brushing it with a soft brush. Next, use a vacuum hose to remove any remaining debris from your blanket. Once your blanket is mostly clean, you can wash it with lukewarm to cold water and Woolite™ or specialty saddle pad cleaner to remove any further dirt and sweat. It's important that, after washing, you store your blanket properly on a rack without any tack on top of it to allow it to maintain its shape and thoroughly dry out.\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e","brand":"Tahoe Tack","offers":[{"title":"Black\/Turquoise\/Blue\/Silver\/White","offer_id":39343358509116,"sku":"61-3021-BLU","price":67.99,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true},{"title":"Black\/Gold\/Purple\/Tan\/White","offer_id":39343358541884,"sku":"61-3021-PUR","price":67.99,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true},{"title":"Black\/Gold\/Red\/Tan\/White","offer_id":39343358574652,"sku":"61-3021-RED","price":67.99,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":false},{"title":"Black\/Gold\/Turquoise\/Tan\/White","offer_id":39343358607420,"sku":"61-3021-TRQ","price":67.99,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true}],"thumbnail_url":"\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/1898\/9069\/products\/Livia_Diamond_Weave_Western_Saddle_Pad_Blanket_61-3021-BLU.jpg?v=1622142649","url":"https:\/\/www.tackwholesale.com\/products\/tahoe-tack-34-x-38-livia-new-zealand-wool-western-show-saddle-blanket","provider":"Tack Wholesale","version":"1.0","type":"link"}
