These patented hay bags are the result of years of careful study and testing to create a design that is attractive, functional, durable, high-quality, and preferred by horses. Our bags are constructed of reinforced nylon webbing that is stronger and more durable than any mesh or fabric hay bag. These bags are designed with cross stitches at every intersection and bartack stitching at all stress points along the top, sides, and bottom of the bag.

Our bags are built tough from premium materials and are designed to last for years to come. This hay bag is designed to be a great everyday feeder for most horses and other animals: it measures 19x19x41\" and can hold 1 bale of hay.
