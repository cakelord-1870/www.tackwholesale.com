    <td colspan="2"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Paris Tack’s line of slow feed hay bags has been meticulously designed, tested, and improved over the past 15 years in order to give you a product superior to anything else available on the market. Our unique web front hay bags are designed with cross stitches at every intersection and bartack stitching at all stress points along the top, sides, and bottom of the bag. This hay bag also features our exclusive Super Tough Bottom®: a grid of reinforced nylon webbing that will never rip like solid or mesh bottoms. Our bags are built tough from premium materials and are designed to last for years to come. This hay bag is designed to be a great everyday feeder for most horses and other animals: it measures 22x10x28" and can hold about 2-3 flakes of hay. This hay bag has 3x2” rectangular front openings which will prevent hay wastage and slow down their rate of consumption, but still allow for frustration-free feeding. This premium hay bag also includes a 6-month limited manufacturer's warranty offered by Derby Originals.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">HOLDS 2-3 FLAKES OF HAY - this 22x10x28" hay bag with 3x2” rectangular openings holds approx. 2-3 flakes of Timothy, Orchard, Alfalfa, or any other type of hay. Our hay bags were designed to minimize frustration and can be stuffed in seconds.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">SUPER TOUGH BOTTOM® DESIGN - our exclusive Super Tough Bottom® is made of reinforced overlapping nylon webbing. This design allows for superior strength and durability while keeping your hay fresh and allowing dust and debris to exit the bag.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">DURABLE LASTING CONSTRUCTION - our heavy-duty reinforced nylon hay bag has replaceable hanging straps and snaps. This allows you to easily replace worn parts, extending the life of the bag. Many customers say their hay bag has lasted 3+ years!</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">IMPROVES DIGESTION - horses are designed to spend up to 18 hours a day grazing. Slow feeding allows you to replicate this natural behavior and is recommended by veterinarians to prevent gastric ulcers, colic, and boredom-related behavioral vices.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">SIX MONTH WARRANTY - this hay bag has a 6-month limited manufacturer's warranty offered by Derby Originals. This warranty covers manufacturing defects. Accidental damage or wear and tear is not covered. Contact the manufacturer for more information.</span></li>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">EASY TO HANG – this hay bag features a pair of d-rings at the top which allows these hay bags to easily be hung using rope or snaps, hung in a stall or from a fence, inside a trailer, or whichever way you prefer!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">GENEROUS SIZING – these hay bags are generously sized and perfect for use in the stall, trailer, at pasture, or at a show due to their large sizing at 19" L x 19" H x 12" W.</span></p></td>

    <td colspan="2"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Paris Tack’s line of slow feed hay bags has been meticulously designed, tested, and improved over the past 15 years in order to give you a product superior to anything else available on the market. Our unique web front hay bags are designed with cross stitches at every intersection and bartack stitching at all stress points along the top, sides, and bottom of the bag. This hay bag also features our exclusive Super Tough Bottom®: a grid of reinforced nylon webbing that will never rip like solid or mesh bottoms. Our bags are built tough from premium materials and are designed to last for years to come. This hay bag is designed to be a great everyday feeder for most horses and other animals: it measures 21x7x25" and can hold about 2-3 flakes of hay. This hay bag has 1” square front openings which will prevent hay wastage and slow down their rate of consumption, but still allow for frustration-free feeding. This premium hay bag also includes a 6-month limited manufacturer's warranty offered by Derby Originals.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">HOLDS 2-3 FLAKES OF HAY - this 21x7x25" hay bag with 1" square openings holds approx. 2-3 flakes of Timothy, Orchard, Alfalfa, or any other type of hay. Our hay bags were designed to minimize frustration and can be stuffed in seconds.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">SUPER TOUGH BOTTOM® DESIGN - our exclusive Super Tough Bottom® is made of reinforced overlapping nylon webbing. This design allows for superior strength and durability while keeping your hay fresh and allowing dust and debris to exit the bag.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">DURABLE LASTING CONSTRUCTION - our heavy-duty reinforced nylon hay bag has replaceable hanging straps and snaps. This allows you to easily replace worn parts, extending the life of the bag. Many customers say their hay bag has lasted 3+ years!</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">IMPROVES DIGESTION - horses are designed to spend up to 18 hours a day grazing. Slow feeding allows you to replicate this natural behavior and is recommended by veterinarians to prevent gastric ulcers, colic, and boredom-related behavioral vices.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">SIX MONTH WARRANTY - this hay bag has a 6-month limited manufacturer's warranty offered by Derby Originals. This warranty covers manufacturing defects. Accidental damage or wear and tear is not covered. Contact the manufacturer for more information.</span></li>

    <td colspan="2"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CuteNfuzzy's line of small pet hay feeders first premiered in 2019 and were meticulously designed and tested here in the USA. We're proud to have created a line of attractive, high-quality, innovative, long-lasting, and best-selling hay feeders designed for use with any small animal such as guinea pigs, rabbits, chinchillas, degus, and even reptiles such as tortoises! These bags are designed for easy, hassle-free, waste-free, and mess-free hay feeding. Unlike traditional wooden, plastic, or metal hay feeders that are intrusive, heavy, hard to fill, and can become dangerous for your pet, our feeders are completely safe and easy to use.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each of our small pet hay bags features a pair of high-quality stainless steel trigger snaps that make hanging this bag a breeze, as well as a d-ring on the back so you can anchor the bag to your cage wall to prevent your pet from moving or flipping it. Our bags also have a full velcro closing top to prevent hay spillage. You'll love how much less hay is wasted and how much cleaner your pet's cage stays with our hay bags! Our feeders were designed to be as hygienic as possible by keeping your hay dry and unsoiled. These bags are also easy to clean and feature a waterproof inner lining. All of the seams on these bags are sturdily reinforced for maximum longevity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Small animals have teeth that never stop growing, so they need to constantly chew in order to keep their teeth from becoming overgrown. Some pets are heavier chewers than others, and while most will not chew fabric, some pets may shred, rip, or eat fabric. For the pets who do this, we do not recommend the use of a fabric hay bag for them as they could try to ingest the fabric. Please take your pet’s individual personality, needs, and safety into consideration when choosing a hay feeder for them. We recommend keeping your hay bag full and not letting it become empty for lengths of time in order to lessen the risk of them eating the fabric. If your hay bag becomes damaged, immediately discontinue using it.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>DESIGNED WITH YOUR PETS SAFETY IN MIND - this hay bag features an all-fabric durable nylon web design with 1.25" x 2" openings for increased safety, comfort for your pet, and durability. Our hay bags were proudly designed in the USA and tested extensively.</span></li>
<li><span>PERFECT FOR GUINEA PIGS, RABBITS, CHINCHILLAS, AND MORE - these hay bags were designed for use with a wide variety of hay eating small animals. Our hay bags are sized to hold a generous amount of hay, and are safe for every day and long-term use.</span></li>
<li><span>NOT DESIGNED FOR HEAVY CHEWERS - some small pets will chew/eat fabric. For these pets, we recommend that you do not use a fabric hay feeder as they may try to ingest the fabric. Always monitor your pet and remove the hay bag if it becomes damaged.</span></li>
<li><span>EXCLUSIVE SUPER TOUGH BOTTOM DESIGN - originally designed for horses, this bottom is more durable and keeps hay fresher by providing better air flow and allowing dust to exit your pet's hay. This also makes accessing the hay easier for your pet.</span></li>
<li><span>AVAILABLE IN MULTIPLE SIZES AND COLORS - this hay pouch is available in two sizes: Small (10" long x 11" tall x 3” wide) and Large (15" long x 11" tall x 3” wide), and the colors Black, Hurricane Blue, Pink, and Dark Purple to best suit you and your pet's needs!</span></li>

    <td colspan="2"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CuteNfuzzy's line of small pet hay feeders first premiered in 2019 and were meticulously designed and tested here in the USA. We're proud to have created a line of attractive, high-quality, innovative, long-lasting, and best-selling hay feeders designed for use with any small animal such as guinea pigs, rabbits, chinchillas, degus, and even reptiles such as tortoises! These bags are designed for easy, hassle-free, waste-free, and mess-free hay feeding. Unlike traditional wooden, plastic, or metal hay feeders that are intrusive, heavy, hard to fill, and can become dangerous for your pet, our feeders are completely safe and easy to use.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each of our small pet hay bags features a pair of high-quality stainless steel trigger snaps that make hanging this bag a breeze, as well as a d-ring on the back so you can anchor the bag to your cage wall to prevent your pet from moving or flipping it. Our bags also have a full velcro closing top to prevent hay spillage. You'll love how much less hay is wasted and how much cleaner your pet's cage stays with our hay bags! Our feeders were designed to be as hygienic as possible by keeping your hay dry and unsoiled. These bags are also easy to clean and feature a waterproof inner lining. All of the seams on these bags are sturdily reinforced for maximum longevity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Small animals have teeth that never stop growing, so they need to constantly chew in order to keep their teeth from becoming overgrown. Some pets are heavier chewers than others, and while most will not chew fabric, some pets may shred, rip, or eat fabric. For the pets who do this, we do not recommend the use of a fabric hay bag for them as they could try to ingest the fabric. Please take your pet’s individual personality, needs, and safety into consideration when choosing a hay feeder for them. We recommend keeping your hay bag full and not letting it become empty for lengths of time in order to lessen the risk of them eating the fabric. If your hay bag becomes damaged, immediately discontinue using it.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">DESIGNED WITH YOUR PETS SAFETY IN MIND - this hay bag features an all-fabric durable nylon web design with  1" square openings for increased safety, comfort for your pet, and durability. Our hay bags were proudly designed in the USA and tested extensively.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">PERFECT FOR GUINEA PIGS, RABBITS, CHINCHILLAS, AND MORE - these hay bags were designed for use with a wide variety of hay eating small animals. Our hay bags are sized to hold a generous amount of hay, and are safe for every day and long-term use.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">NOT DESIGNED FOR HEAVY CHEWERS - some small pets will chew/eat fabric. For these pets, we recommend that you do not use a fabric hay feeder as they may try to ingest the fabric. Always monitor your pet and remove the hay bag if it becomes damaged.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">EXCLUSIVE SUPER TOUGH BOTTOM DESIGN - originally designed for horses, this bottom is more durable and keeps hay fresher by providing better air flow and allowing dust to exit your pet's hay. This also makes accessing the hay easier for your pet.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">MEASURES 15" LONG x 9" TALL x 5" WIDE - this hay bag is sized to perfectly fit inside most cages and comfortably accommodate 1-4 small pets. This feeder features an open nylon web front with 1" square openings to allow up to four animals to eat at once.</span></li>

    <td colspan="2"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CuteNfuzzy's line of small pet hay feeders first premiered in 2019 and were meticulously designed and tested here in the USA. We're proud to have created a line of attractive, high-quality, innovative, long-lasting, and best-selling hay feeders designed for use with any small animal such as guinea pigs, rabbits, chinchillas, degus, and even reptiles such as tortoises! These bags are designed for easy, hassle-free, waste-free, and mess-free hay feeding. Unlike traditional wooden, plastic, or metal hay feeders that are intrusive, heavy, hard to fill, and can become dangerous for your pet, our feeders are completely safe and easy to use.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each of our small pet hay bags features a pair of high-quality stainless steel trigger snaps that make hanging this bag a breeze, as well as a d-ring on the back so you can anchor the bag to your cage wall to prevent your pet from moving or flipping it. Our bags also have a full velcro closing top to prevent hay spillage. You'll love how much less hay is wasted and how much cleaner your pet's cage stays with our hay bags! Our feeders were designed to be as hygienic as possible by keeping your hay dry and unsoiled. These bags are also easy to clean and feature a waterproof inner lining. All of the seams on these bags are sturdily reinforced for maximum longevity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Small animals have teeth that never stop growing, so they need to constantly chew in order to keep their teeth from becoming overgrown. Some pets are heavier chewers than others, and while most will not chew fabric, some pets may shred, rip, or eat fabric. For the pets who do this, we do not recommend the use of a fabric hay bag for them as they could try to ingest the fabric. Please take your pet’s individual personality, needs, and safety into consideration when choosing a hay feeder for them. We recommend keeping your hay bag full and not letting it become empty for lengths of time in order to lessen the risk of them eating the fabric. If your hay bag becomes damaged, immediately discontinue using it.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">DESIGNED WITH YOUR PETS SAFETY IN MIND - this hay bag features an all-fabric durable 1000D nylon design with large openings for increased safety, comfort for your pet, and durability. Our hay bags were proudly designed in the USA and tested extensively.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">PERFECT FOR GUINEA PIGS, RABBITS, CHINCHILLAS, AND MORE - these hay bags were designed for use with a wide variety of hay eating small animals. Our hay bags are sized to hold a generous amount of hay, and are safe for every day and long-term use.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">NOT DESIGNED FOR HEAVY CHEWERS - some small pets will chew/eat fabric. For these pets, we recommend that you do not use a fabric hay feeder as they may try to ingest the fabric. Always monitor your pet and remove the hay bag if it becomes damaged.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">MEASURES 15" LONG x 15" TALL x 5" WIDE - this hay bag is sized to fit inside most large cages and comfortably accommodate 1-3 small pets. This feeder features three front 2.5" diameter circular openings to allow up to three animals to eat at once.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">AVAILABLE IN MULTIPLE COLORS AND PATTERNS - our fun and colorful small pet hay feeders are available in the colors Black, Hurricane Blue, Pink, Purple, Green, and Rainbow Geometry so that you can find the perfect bag to match your pet's cage.</span></li>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Derby Originals is the original inventor of the 4-sided hay bag, U.S. Patent No. D742,078. Our four-sided hay bags are the only bags on the market that allow your horse to freely eat from any part of the hay bag. These patented hay bags are the result of years of careful study and testing to create a design that is attractive, functional, durable, high-quality, and preferred by horses. Our bags are constructed of reinforced nylon webbing that is stronger and more durable than any mesh or fabric hay bag. These bags are designed with cross stitches at every intersection and bartack stitching at all stress points along the top, sides, and bottom of the bag. This hay bag also features our exclusive Super Tough Bottom®: a grid of reinforced nylon webbing that will never rip like solid or mesh bottoms. Our bags are built tough from premium materials and are designed to last for years to come. This hay bag is designed to be a great everyday feeder for most horses and other animals: it measures 19x19x41" and can hold 1 bale of hay. This hay bag has 1.75” square openings which will prevent hay wastage and slow down their rate of consumption, but still allow for frustration-free feeding. This premium hay bag also includes a 1-year limited manufacturer's warranty offered by Derby Originals.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">HOLDS 1 BALE OF HAY - this 19x19x41" hay bag with 1.75" square openings holds approx. 1 bale of Timothy, Orchard, Alfalfa, or any other type of hay. Our hay bags were designed to minimize frustration and can be stuffed in seconds.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">EXCLUSIVE PATENTED 4-SIDED CONSTRUCTION - this hay bag features Derby Originals patented nylon web design that allows your horse to eat from any part of the hay bag. This design eliminates the risk of material rips and tears found in other hay bags.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">SUPER TOUGH BOTTOM® DESIGN - our exclusive Super Tough Bottom® is made of reinforced overlapping nylon webbing. This design allows for superior strength and durability while keeping your hay fresh and allowing dust and debris to exit the bag.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">IMPROVES DIGESTION - horses are designed to spend up to 18 hours a day grazing. Slow feeding allows you to replicate this natural behavior and is recommended by veterinarians to prevent gastric ulcers, colic, and boredom-related behavioral vices.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">ONE YEAR WARRANTY - this hay bag has a 1-year limited manufacturer's warranty offered by Derby Originals. This warranty covers manufacturing defects. Accidental damage or wear and tear is not covered. Contact the manufacturer for more information.</span></li>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Derby Originals is the original inventor of the 4-sided hay bag, U.S. Patent No. D742,078. Our four-sided hay bags are the only bags on the market that allow your horse to freely eat from any part of the hay bag. These patented hay bags are the result of years of careful study and testing to create a design that is attractive, functional, durable, high-quality, and preferred by horses. Our bags are constructed of reinforced nylon webbing that is stronger and more durable than any mesh or fabric hay bag. These bags are designed with cross stitches at every intersection and bartack stitching at all stress points along the top, sides, and bottom of the bag. This hay bag also features our exclusive Super Tough Bottom®: a grid of reinforced nylon webbing that will never rip like solid or mesh bottoms. Our bags are built tough from premium materials and are designed to last for years to come. This hay bag is designed to be a great everyday feeder for most horses and other animals: it measures 22x8x25" and can hold about 2-3 flakes of hay. This hay bag has 1.75” square openings which will prevent hay wastage and slow down their rate of consumption, but still allow for frustration-free feeding. This premium hay bag also includes a 1-year limited manufacturer's warranty offered by Derby Originals.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">HOLDS 2-3 FLAKES OF HAY - this 22x8x25" hay bag with 1.75" square openings holds approx. 2-3 flakes of Timothy, Orchard, Alfalfa, or any other type of hay. Our hay bags were designed to minimize frustration and can be stuffed in seconds.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">EXCLUSIVE PATENTED 4-SIDED CONSTRUCTION - this hay bag features Derby Originals patented nylon web design that allows your horse to eat from any part of the hay bag. This design eliminates the risk of material rips and tears found in other hay bags.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">SUPER TOUGH BOTTOM® DESIGN - our exclusive Super Tough Bottom® is made of reinforced overlapping nylon webbing. This design allows for superior strength and durability while keeping your hay fresh and allowing dust and debris to exit the bag.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">IMPROVES DIGESTION - horses are designed to spend up to 18 hours a day grazing. Slow feeding allows you to replicate this natural behavior and is recommended by veterinarians to prevent gastric ulcers, colic, and boredom-related behavioral vices.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">ONE YEAR WARRANTY - this hay bag has a 1-year limited manufacturer's warranty offered by Derby Originals. This warranty covers manufacturing defects. Accidental damage or wear and tear is not covered. Contact the manufacturer for more information.</span></li>

<ul>
<li>OPEN SIDED - this hanging hay bag is unique in that it is completely open and designed to work from any angle, making it ideal for feeding multiple animals at once or for providing a more open and accessible hay source.</li>
<li>EASY TO FILL AND HANG - these hay bags have a fully opening top which makes filling them incredibly easy and stress-free, and they’re easily hung with the included 7.5’ long heavy-duty fixed loop poly rope strap. Simply tie the strap to a sturdy object at a comfortable height for your horses and you’re set!</li>
<li>GREAT FOR PASTURE USE - because of this bag’s incredible durability and open design, it’s perfect for use in the pasture where multiple animals will be eating and where you don’t want excess waste.</li>
<li>NOT JUST FOR HORSES - this hay bag has been designed to work for other types of livestock as well as horses, from sheep and goats to cattle, donkeys, llamas, alpacas, and more!</li>
